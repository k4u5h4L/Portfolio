# My portfolio

This portfolio has been made with React.

This is a fork of [this](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) project.

Some items are changed as compared to the original repo.

## To run:

-   Clone and cd into the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/theParanoidScripts/theParanoidScripts.github.io.git && cd theParanoidScripts.github.io
```

-   Install the needed dependencies

```
npm install
```

-   Now rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env` and insert your github access token for information about your repositories.

-   Now run the development server

```
npm run start
```

A server will be created at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Note:

-   Special thanks for [saadpasta](https://github.com/saadpasta/) and the contributors for this amazing website!

-   The original repo has GNU public liscense, hence I am legally allowed to modify the source code and use it.
